# Functional Program Design in Scala (progfun2)

1. For Expressions and Monads, including functional random generators
2. Lazy Evaluation: streams (lazy lists)
3. Functions and State: side effects (the "real world")
4. Event handling, with an introduction to Functional Reactive Programming; also, Futures
5. (Type-Directed Programming: Scala's `implicit` has since been added as Week 3: Futures have been removed from the course to make way.)

Is the next most natural course to pursue ["Programming Reactive Systems"](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-reactive-systems)? I think so.
