# Functional Programming Principles in Scala (progfun1)

1. Substitution Model (Expression Evaluation) and Tail Recursion
2. Higher-order Functions (incl. Currying) and Data Abstraction
3. Class Hierarchies and Polymorphism
4. Functions as Objects, Generics, Variance, and Pattern Matching (Decomposition context)
5. Lists (immutable linked list, Cons List: Fold Left, Fold Right, and much more)
6. Collections and For-Expressions
